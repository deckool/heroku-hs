So you sweat naked, you *breathe* naked, you _eat_ naked.

Lots of people ask me about the CV and portofolio yet i did not heard one of them having also the option for a paid work test.
I am born on my first day, followed school just like anybody else, 12 years + university, i worked, i also quit few times, i know this and that.

Why not go **All the way naked**
