Sweat naked
-----------

The very first character in the md file must be the issue number. Here, it is simple 1

>!important (as in css)
>This app, now connected to a server it is live. So, any change or comment added will be shown only after the webhook, the api, will compile it.
>Not for long anyway! There will be a lot of new features as days pass by.

So you sweat naked, you *breathe* naked, you _eat_ naked.

That's some text with a footnote for discount.[^1]

Ok, so for the last week i worked around haskellers `github` wrapper for Github API.
This is just a __demo__ of what it may become. It also does not store all of the datas on Github but on an internal haskell server written using SnapFramework.

Lots of people ask me about the CV and portofolio yet i did not heard one of them having also the option for a paid work test.
I am born on my first day, followed school just like anybody else, 12 years + university, i worked, i also quit few times, i know this and that.

Why not go **All the way naked**

working with git API, refs and SHA's, now with webhooks
